# Mod3-UX/UI-Challenge Fitness Tracker

## Group: Steven Lee Lawson, Patrick McLaughlin, and Charles Yach

## Overview
In this challenge we are asked to create a user persona worksheet, wireframes for mobile and desktop, and final comps for mobile and desktop layouts built in Sketch. We then hand these off to another team for them to develope.

Below is what we were given from another team. Our objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design to reflect the designerâ€™s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail.
